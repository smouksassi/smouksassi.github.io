Welcome!

This is the first post in my personal blog. I have been working in the Modeling and Simulation field for 20 years and I started this blog to share my experience and how general solutions were developed to tackle specific and more general problems. I will keep this first post short and leave you with one of the dose exposure figures (using dummy data) that I developed for an FDA submission 15 years ago. Through out the years these visuals has evolved and are now part of my [ggquickeda](https://smouksassi.github.io/ggquickeda/ "ggquickeda is an R Shiny app/package providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to ggplot2 and table1") package that will be covered in future posts.

This visual include several components:

-   distribution of exposures (AUC) by dose level

-   for each distribution we show the percentage of it falling within a specific quantile of AUC

-   in the middle we have a table detailing for Placebo and each Quartile: **AUC bins**, **Total N** of patients, N of **Responders**, and the observed **Percentage** of response

-   in the upper panel a logistic fit and its 95%CI of the probability of clinical response versus AUC is shown.

-   The predicted response by dose level at the 10th, 25th, median,75th and 90th of exposure is shown and projected on the logistic curve

-   The predicted response is also projected on Y axis for head to head comparison across doses and to appreciate the saturation at the highest dose levels/exposures
