    "text": "This is the first post in my personal blog. Welcome! I have been working in the Modeling and Simulation field for 20 years and I started this blog to share my experience and how general solutions were developed to tackle specific and more general problems. I will leave with one of the dose exposure figures (using dummy data) that I developed for an FDA submission. Throuhg out the years these visuals has evolved and are now part of my ggquickeda package.\n\nThis visual include several components:\n\ndistribution of exposures (AUC) by dose level\nfor each distribution we show the percentage of it falling within a specific quantile of AUC\nin the middle we have a table detailing for Placebo and each Quartile: AUC bins, Total N of patients, N of Responders, and the observed Percentage of response\nin the upper panel a logistic fit and its 95%CI of the probability of clinical response versus AUC is shown.\nThe predicted response by dose level at the 10th, 25th, median,75th and 90th of exposure is shown and projected on the logistic curve\nThe predicted response is also projected on Y axis for head to head comparison across doses and to appreciate the saturation at the highest dose levels/exposures"

    "text": "Hi, I am currently Full Professional Researcher at UCSF. My current and previous roles involved leading, mentoring and building pharmacometrics teams across the globe first with Pharsight in Montreal Canada and later with Certara in Cairo (Egypt) and Cape Town (South Africa). During the last 20 years, together with my teams, I have contributed to many FDA, EMA, PMDA, China and Health Canada approvals across various therapeutic areas namely in rare diseases in adults and pediatric populations.\nI have a passion for teaching and for building tools that empower non-coders to communicate efficiently. Some of my R packages include (coveffectsplot, ggquickeda and tidyvpc).\nMy core services include pharmacometrics analyses to support your drug development programs. If you would like us to discuss feel free to send me an email !"
