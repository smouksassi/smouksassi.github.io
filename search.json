We will start with a simpler version where we show the Endpoint versus exposures, which in this case are areas under the drug concentrations curves (AUC) on top.

First we reshape the data into long format to accomodate the possibility of multiple endpoints and multiple exposure metrics. Second we compute the quartiles of exposures by exposure metric and endpoint, keeping the Placebo separate. Then we add the variable exptile that will assign to each exposure one of the following values: “Placebo”, “Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, “Q4”. We also compute the exposure limits that can be used in the graph to show the limits of each quartile.\n\n\nCode\nexposure_metric_plac_value &lt;- 0\n# compute quantiles and assign each exposure to its corresponding exptile\nICGIlong &lt;- ICGI %&gt;% \n  gather(Endpoint,response,ICGI)    %&gt;% # can handle multiple endpoints at the same time \n  gather(expname,expvalue,AUC,CMAX) %&gt;% # can handle multiple exposures at the same time\n  group_by(Endpoint,expname) %&gt;% \n  mutate( Q25     = quantile(expvalue[!expvalue %in% c(exposure_metric_plac_value)], 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), \n          Q50     = quantile(expvalue[!expvalue %in% c(exposure_metric_plac_value)], 0.50, na.rm = TRUE), \n          Q75     = quantile(expvalue[!expvalue %in% c(exposure_metric_plac_value)], 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), \n          exptile = case_when(expvalue == exposure_metric_plac_value ~ \"Placebo\",\n                            expvalue &gt; exposure_metric_plac_value & expvalue &lt;= Q25\n                                                               ~ \"Q1\",\n                            expvalue &gt;  Q25 & expvalue &lt;=  Q50 ~ \"Q2\",\n                            expvalue &gt;  Q50 & expvalue &lt;= Q75  ~ \"Q3\",\n                            expvalue &gt;  Q75                    ~ \"Q4\"))\n\nexposurelimits &lt;- ICGIlong %&gt;% \n  group_by(expname, Endpoint)%&gt;% \n  reframe(intercept = quantile(expvalue[!expvalue %in%\n                         c( exposure_metric_plac_value)], \n                         c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), na.rm = TRUE),\n              quant =    c(0,0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))\n\n\nWe prepare the distributions plot beneath the probability of response curve by using ggridges, constructing a numrical value for where to plot the distributions and by excluding the Placebo from the distributions plot.

    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is the first post in my personal blog. I have been working in the Modeling and Simulation field for 20 years and I started this blog to share my experience and how general solutions were developed to tackle specific and more general problems. I will keep this first post short and leave you with one of the dose exposure figures (using dummy data) that I developed for an FDA submission 15 years ago. Through out the years these visuals has evolved and are now part of my ggquickeda package that will be covered in future posts.\n\nThis visual include several components:\n\ndistribution of exposures (AUC) by dose level\nfor each distribution we show the percentage of it falling within a specific quantile of AUC\nin the middle we have a table detailing for Placebo and each Quartile: AUC bins, Total N of patients, N of Responders, and the observed Percentage of response\nin the upper panel a logistic fit and its 95%CI of the probability of clinical response versus AUC is shown.\nThe predicted response by dose level at the 10th, 25th, median,75th and 90th of exposure is shown and projected on the logistic curve\nThe predicted response is also projected on Y axis for head to head comparison across doses and to appreciate the saturation at the highest dose levels/exposures"
