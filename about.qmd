Hi, I am currently Full Professional Researcher at UCSF. My current and previous roles involved leading, mentoring and building pharmacometrics teams across the globe first with Pharsight in Montreal Canada and later with Certara in Cairo (Egypt) and Cape Town (South Africa). During the last 20 years, together with my teams, I have contributed to many FDA, EMA, PMDA, China and Health Canada approvals across various therapeutic areas namely in rare diseases in adults and pediatric populations.

I have a passion for teaching and for building tools that empower non-coders to communicate efficiently. Some of my R packages include (coveffectsplot, ggquickeda and tidyvpc).

My core services include pharmacometrics analyses to support your drug development programs. If you would like us to discuss feel free to send me an email !
